### Description:
- A Simple Ping Pong Game Using Turtle in Python. It's made for fun and to double check my understanding of the concepts of Python. One of the struggles I faced when doing this project is making the motion of the ball smooth so that the game look convenient to anyone who tries it.

### To run the Game:
- Type this in the terminal: `python ping-pong.py`
